# Project About:

Create an automation framework in Java that compares 2 csv files and identifies &amp; reports the
differences between the 2 files if applicable. If the two csv files are identical, it should report that the
files are identical.
Make sure the differences are clearly identified so results can be easily triaged.
We would like to see the different csv files you would create to validate that your code covers all
different scenarios or test data. Please include a README file with instruction on how to run your code
(Screenshots would help)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version X or above)
- An IDE like [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

### How to Clone a GitHub Project
* Clone via Command Line (Terminal)

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder where you want to save the project:

For ex: cd path/to/your/desired/folder


Run the git clone command with your repo URL:

 git clone <the project URL from Git repo>


This will download the project folder inside your current directory.

## How to Clone the Project

1. Open your IDE.

2. Choose the option to **Clone a Git repository** (this may be under File > New > Project from Version Control, or directly in the welcome screen):

   - **Repository URL:**  
     `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`

3. Select a local directory where you want to save the project.

4. Finish the cloning process — your IDE will download the project files.

## How to Run the Java Project

### In Eclipse:

1. After cloning and importing the project:

   - If Eclipse doesn't automatically recognize it as a Java project, right-click the project → **Configure** → **Convert to Java Project** (if available).

2. Make sure your Java files are inside the `src` folder.

3. Right-click the main Java file containing the `main` method (e.g., `Main.java`) → **Run As** → **Java Application**.

---

### In IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and choose **Open**.

2. Navigate to the cloned project directory and select it.

3. IntelliJ should automatically detect it as a Java project.

4. Locate the Java file with the `main` method, right-click it → **Run 'Main.main()'**.

---

## Additional Notes

- Ensure your JDK is correctly configured in the IDE.

- If your project uses any external libraries, add them to your build path accordingly.

Feel free to customize this with your project name, main class filename, and repo URL!

If you want, I can generate a customized README with your exact repo name and main Java file name — just tell me!
